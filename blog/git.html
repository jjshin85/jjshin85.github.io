      Salutations, dear reader! It is my pleasure and priviledge and responsibility that can't be shirked to tell you of the joys and wonders of Version Control. What is version control, you ask? Well, it's what's going to save your life on multiple occassions. It's basically like a save point in a video game but for your code, with the added exception that you can go back to any save point you want. Allow me to explain:
    </p>
     <p>
       Let's say you're writing a program and you're working on it piece by piece, working on a section here, then a section there. Then you introduce a new bit of code and all of a sudden everything goes to hell. You don't know what's wrong, just that it worked before and it doesn't work now. With version control you can revert back to the previous draft of your work from the save point. Or maybe you deleted some code that you found out later you still needed, or it was written more efficiently before. With version control, it's like hopping in a time machine and bringing up the work from the previous day, or the previous week, or whenever the save point is from. You can even compare your current working version to previous iterations. It's like Marty McFly seeing his younger self in Back to the Future II...Okay, maybe not quite like that, but you can do side by side comparisons to see differences.

       If you're collaborating with others, it's a great way to track changes. You can create different 'branches' of a project, cloning a file/project from a master copy code so you and your collaborators aren't saving to the same file and writing over each others work. When you're ready, you can merge your sub-branch back to the main-branch.

       This is where GitHub comes in. Git is a form of version control, but it's stored locally on your computer. GitHub on the other hand is version control, but everything's stored on a server in the cloud. It's like a suped up version of dropbox, all your stuff is on the cloud and you or your collaborators can access, modify, upload whatever you want there. It's a great way to get your work out there, look at what other people are working on, download other people's code, and upload your own. Okay, I said it's like dropbox, but that doesn't quite do it justice. It's also like Behance or Deviant art, it's a place for you to keep your portfolio, to talk and get feedback about code.
