        Josh Shin works as an ESL teacher. After years of searching, should he ever decide to pursue a career in hip-hop, he has finally settled on the MC name 'Vaudevillain'. Unfortunately, all the social media sites he has hitherto signed up for have shown this has already been taken. He sometimes contemplates releasing an album just to beat someone to the name. God knows he regrets not forming an eponymous band with his brothers and beating 'The Shins' to the punch. His family's dreams of becoming the next Hansen are forever dashed.
