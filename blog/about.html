      Joshua Shin is an educator and illustrator. Joshua is currently working as an ESL teacher. He has an academic background in continental philosophy (phenomenology is his jam), is kind of obsessed with serialized fiction, wishes he was in vaudeville, and his favorite ninja turtle was Donatello... so really, his learning programming makes all the more sense in hindsight.

      (He also has a predilection for speaking parenthetically.)
