  <h1>Looping in Ruby and Looping in Javascript</h1>

      There are a variety of ways to loop in Ruby, using the <span class="block">.each</span> method, or the <span class="block">for</span> or <span class="block">while</span> loops. The use of these methods looks like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="block">
        array = [1,1,1,1]
        <br>
        sum = 0
        <br>
        for i in 0...array.size
        <br>
        &nbsp; sum += array[i]
        <br>
        end
        <br>
        #=> 4
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the above example, <span class="block">for i in 0...array.size</span> tells ruby to iterate for variable i from 0 to 4, which is the size of the array. All done with a minimum of expressions. Also, the <span class = "block">...</span> means to exclude the last digit, whereas <span class ="block">...</span> would mean to include it within the range.
    </p>
    <p>
      Javascript is a bit more cumbersome:
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="block">
        var array = [1,1,1,1];
        <br>
        var sum = 0;
        for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++)
        <br>
        {
        <br>
        &nbsp; sum += array[i];
        <br>
        }
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      After declaring variable <span class="block">i</span>, you tell the program the range you want it to go until, which in this case is <span class="block">i < array.length</span>. Then you declare how you want to iterate <span class="block">i</span>, which in this case is by adding 1 to each iteration, which is represented by <span class="block">i++</span>. And then all of these are separated by a semicolon. Also important to note is you must specify that each variable is a variable by putting <span class="block">var</span> in front of the variable name every time you first declare it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruby also has more built in methods that will allow you to loop through something, such as <span class="block">.each</span>, or span class="block">.map</span>.
