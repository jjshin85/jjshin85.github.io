  <h1>Computer Memory</h1>

      Computer memory. While our own memories might be vague, complex, compact, diffuse, abstract, ethereal, or clear as day, computer memory consists of 1's and 0's. It's like there are a bunch of lockers, and each can only hold one bit of information.

      There are two types of memory: volatile and non-volatile. Volatile memory means that it needs a running current to hold the information. RAM (Random Access Memory) is volatile, and it's where the data that a computer's operating system, and data in current use are kept so they can be accessed quickly, and the user can read and write data very rapidly. And RAM only holds the information for as long as the computer is running. In contrast, non-volatile memory, such as the memory stored on a hard drive, is stored sequentially and so takes much longer to read and write.
