  <h1>Issues in Tech: Online Security</h1>

      Online Security. An issue rising in cultural awareness. Ten years ago, people would be surprised or shocked if their credit card number was stolen or their bank account was hacked. Now it's common place. In fact, my credit card number was stolen just two weeks ago. I racked my brain, thinking of how they could've done it. Was it through a phishing scam, the old bait 'n switch where someone clicks on a webpage or an email that looks legit and is duped into giving up their sensitive info. Or maybe I gave my info to a legit website whose servers weren't secure. Or maybe I was even victim to a 'skimmer', a physical device hackers attatch to the card slots of atms that read your credit card information.

      With the way tech has integrated into our daily lives, security is of increasing importance. Just knowing what to watch out for is helpful, but many, myself included, take security for granted. Even the director of the CIA John Brennan was hacked by a couple of teenagers. I'm going to repeat this here, THE DIRECTOR OF THE CIA WAS HACKED BY TEENAGERS. And often times, hacking isn't done by some sophisticated code that somehow gets through the most sophisticated firewalls and security measures. Often times, hackers get access by social engineering, like the phishing scams I mentioned earlier. A link might look legit, and it tricks you into voluntarily giving your info. Teens hacked Brennan by calling AOL, giving the tech representative the last 4 digits of Brennan's credit card and other similar security questions.<sup><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/10/hacker-who-broke-into-cia-director-john-brennan-email-tells-how-he-did-it/">1</a></sup>

     I'll probably never know exactly how my credit card number was compromised. There are just too many possibilities. Maybe someone got access to my computer as I was using a cafe's wifi. I don't even know what risks I put myself in if I use public wifi, what kind of actions I should and shouldn't do. Usually, and I'm sure this is like most people, my passwords are combinations of the same word or words, with variations in number combinations afterwards. Or you know, it's just "password123!". But for a lot of people, technology is magic, and they don't even consider these things. I work at a company that provides ESL classes for foreigners, and I was shocked and horrified to find out that the administrative staff have access to the students passwords for the site in plain text, completely unencrypted. When I told my boss they shouldn't have this information, my boss replied it made their job much easier because they didn't have to jump through hurdles to reset information or access student records. If like most people, a student uses the same password across multiple accounts, this makes their password incredibly unsecure. And this is a mistake that's simply due to laziness or convenience, because security is usually an afterthought.
