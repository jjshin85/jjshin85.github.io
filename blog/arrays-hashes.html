      <h2>Arrays:</h2>
      An array is a way to organize and keep track of information. It's basically a list. Well, the way I think of it is more like a train in which the cars hold data objects. You can put any kind of data object in the cars... even sad Keanu.
      <br>
      <br>

      <br>
      <br>
      If you're just looking at a list, then it's a 1-dimensional array. It might look something like this:
      <ol start="0">
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
        <li>Item 4</li>
      </ol>
      Also important to keep in mind is that these arrays are '0 relative', meaning they start their count at 0. Notice 'Item 1' is in the index position 0, and 'Item 2' is in the index position '1'.
      <br>
      <br>
      These are very useful if you have a lot of information to organize and sort through. You can also keep arrays of arrays. In this way, you basically have a table, each element of the parent array acting like a row in the table.
      <br>
      <br>
      The following is a random table of a phonbook I found online.
      <br>
      <br>
      <img src="../imgs/fake_numbers.jpg" alt="table" style="width:310px;height:195px;">
      <br>
      <br>
      In the above example, the parent array is the table itself, and each element in the table is represented by a table row. You could think of it like each row is a train car, to extend my earlier metaphor. And then each element in the array is another array, so each train car holds another train with its own cars.
      <br>
      <br>
      <img src="../imgs/2d_keanu_array.jpg" alt="Keanu 2d array" style="width:300px;height:225px;">
      <br>
      <br>
      As with the above image, you could use an array to hold a list of names with phone numbers, easily adding or deleting names to the array. Each pairing of name and number would be its own array, which in turn would be an element of its 'parent' array of the phonebook. So the phonebook itself is an array, and entry in it is another array which holds the elements of name and number.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h2>Hashes:</h2>
      In contrast to arrays are hashes. A hash is a pairing of a key and its value. Each key must be unique, but a value can be repeated. Whereas each element of an array takes up its own slot in the array, hashes may take up less memory because multiple keys may point to the same value.
      <br>
      <br>
      Wikipedia has a nice picture of this in action:
      <br>
      </p>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Hash_table_4_1_1_0_0_1_0_LL.svg/300px-Hash_table_4_1_1_0_0_1_0_LL.svg.png" alt="Hash-table" style="width:300px;height:230px;">
      <p>
      And whereas the elements of an array are organized by a numerical index, hashes aren't organized in such a way. So if you looked up an item in an array, you'd look it up by its index number. With hashes, you'd look up the value of an element by its key.
      <br>
      <br>
      This can make searching through elements of an array faster for a user, but adding elements into the middle of an array takes up much more time because you have to shift all the elements around. With a hash, they aren't organized by a numerical index, but an element's key is converted into a hash code, which is used to identify its value and where the information is stored. The function/algorithms that converts a key into a hash code reduces the key to a number, meaning it takes less memory to store.
      <br>
      <br>
      Also, if you input the same data using the same hash function/algorithms, it will return the same hash code, meaning it's a good way to verify data. Let's say you've got a data file that you've got two files, both 6 gb large, almost exactly the same but one line of code is different between them, then they'll produce two different hash codes. It's also impossible to reverse the process and recreate the data from the hash code, which makes hashes very useful for cryptography.
