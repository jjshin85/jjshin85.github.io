<!--
  -How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
    It was a lot of fun, it was nice to see what the other person could contribute, seeing as their knowledge of html and websites was a lot greater than mine.

  -Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
    Yes, it helped visualize with greater clarity what would be necessary for the site, and how to best go about building it.
  -What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
    It must be well organized, easy to read and navigate, the information of greater importance should be clearly visible.
  -What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
    I learned about 'article' which is self explanatory, 'figure' and 'figcaption' which are tags for images and their accomanying captions, and 'nav' which is used for a set of navigation links
