-To create repository, simply click on the '+' symbol at the top bar of the github page, and then select the option "create new repository". Afterwards, in your new repository, on the right side of the webpage there should be something that says "HTTPS clone URL"; copy this link, in the terminal navigate to a directory and make sure it's not the same directory as any other repos, and then clone the repo into the directory by typing "git clone url-that-you-copied".

-Open-source means that the source code for something is not proprietary and is open to the public, therefore anyone can have access to the source code and suggest modifications.

-I think open-source is wonderful because it allows tinkerers and hobbyists to also contribute, as well as allowing other professionals and experts to see the inner workings of new technologies. From what I've heard, it's allowed for technological breakthroughs to spread throughout the community and to allow all kind of people to contribute to various projects and breakthroughs. I think it's wonderful and it allows greater diversity in terms of who has access to technology and information, however I don't know the ramifications when it comes to creative copyright and ownership. I'm all about sharing and spreading knowledge, but there are times where a company might come up with a new way of doing things and they might need to beat others to market, or where a major tech conglomerate might take the work of others.

-Licenses are important because they have to do with copyright and copyright infringment, what you can use legally.

-This challenge helped solidify making changes and pushing them. Also, I made a boneheaded mistake by misnaming the repo, and then for expediency I pushed a change directly from the master branch. I know that this isn't a good practice, but I noticed there was no 'pull request' to add and confirm, which solidified that the pull request is a way to limit who has access to make changes to a repo as well as being an additonal way to check and confirm changes one might want to make.

-I used the documentation from the github website a lot. I'm sure there's no need to add it, but I'll do it anyways.
