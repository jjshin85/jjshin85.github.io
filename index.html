      Josh Shin works as an ESL teacher. After years of searching, should he ever decide to pursue a career in hip-hop, he has finally settled on the MC name  Vaudevillain. Unfortunately, all the social media sites he has signed up for have shown this is already taken and he hopes he can release an album before another artist under that name becomes more famous.
