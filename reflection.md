# 3.5 Your Website, Part 3

- What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I learned that padding is the border is the area surrounding/outlining the element, padding is the area between the border and the content of the element, and margin is the area outside the border of an element. Increasing the padding can sometimes push the content of the element away from the border, or if the content is too big it can push the border outwards. Increasing the margin will move the element away from the specified side.

- What did you learn about CSS positioning?
I learned about the different values: absolute, relative, static, and fixed. Static is the default, it'll just put the element where it flows in the html, absolute positions it relative to the parent, relative positions it relative to where it would go in the flow of the html, and fixed permanently positions it within a specified point in the view frame.
- What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
The nav bar proved the most challenging. Also, I would like to change the dimensions so there are margins if the window is very large, but the margins disappear if the window is small. So far, I couldn't find how to do that. It was easiest to change colors and font-sizes, but sometimes figuring out how to define the element in the tree-branch structure was difficult, and figuring out how positioning worked was the most challenging.

- What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I learned I could use multiple stylesheets for one page, which definitely helps with reusability. I also learned how to position elements, how to justify text, how to make divs and elements take up percentages of the screen (I didn't find a need to use that here, but I'm sure that'll be very handy in the future).
